<h1>Meet Goostavo!</h1>
Goostavo is a 3-D printed minature goose created in <b>SolidWorks</b> who's wings can flap up and down if you pull on its head!

<h2>Assembly</h2>
Goostavo's body contains a slot mechanism. As shown in the instruction manual,the wings are connected to the neck piece, and held in place by pins. This is then placed inside the slot in the bottom body and held in place with additional pins. To snap together, the top bottom is placed on the bottom bottom! And viola! Goostavo is 90% assembled!

<h2>Industry Standards</h2>
Goostavo follows industry standards by as it contains pins with different tolerances (0.01cm and 0.3 cm) to allow mechanisms to either be tight fit or loosly fit. Furthermore, symetrical pieces were used (e.g symmetrical holes and pins) to avoid confusion during assembly. 

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ideated, designed and developed a goose with 5+ unique parts by using SolidWorks </li>
<li>Developed a "slot machine" mechanism, allowing the wing to move up and down </li>
<li>Developed a comprehensive assembly manual for user-friendly guidance </li>
<li>Used features such as lofting, global variables, chamfering, extruded boss/cut, reference geometry </li>
</ul>
